My name is Zach, and I'm a software engineer and student currently based in Kansas City. 

### About me

- 🔭 At my day job, I collaborate with my team to create and improve APIs built with ASP.NET and C#, running on AWS's cloud tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how programming languages are designed, compiled, and interpreted.
- 👯 I’m the treasurer and back-end team lead with UMKC's chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery.
- 💬 Ask me about the ACM Code of Ethics and why it matters to me as an engineer!
- 📫 How to reach me: zhalderwood@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am often regarded as surprisingly charismatic for a programmer, and I'm usually the first to volunteer for speaking & presenting in group projects.
